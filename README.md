1.Maze Solver Using Backtracking

Description
This program solves a maze problem using backtracking. It finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the maze.

Problem Statement
Input: A 2D maze where `1` represents an open path and `0` represents a wall.
Output: A solution matrix where `1` represents the path taken, and `0` represents other cells.


1. Define a 2D maze matrix.
2. Run the program to see the solution path or an error if no path exists.

2.Longest Palindromic Substring

Description
This program finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

Problem Statement
Input: A string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000).
Output: The longest substring that is a palindrome.

Usage
1. Define a string as input.
2. Run the program to get the longest palindromic substring.
